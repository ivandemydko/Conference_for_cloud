## Conference Management System
##### Project description:
*Theme â„–1: Conference Management System*

        There are roles: Administrator, Moderator, Speaker and User.
        The moderator can fix, propose, change the topic of the report
        to the speaker, as well as adjust the time and place of the event.
        It is necessary to take into account the possibility 
        of viewing past/future meetings. 
        Each Speaker has his own rating, depending on the rating, 
        more bonuses are awarded. The speaker may propose his Report. 
        There should be statistics of registered people and how many 
        came to the Report.
        Implement notification of participants about events.
